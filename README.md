# OpenGL_Workshop
Here is the collection of files you may pull to get yourself started on using OpenGL in Visual Studio!

This is in conjunction with the CSE Club Computer Graphics Workshop, found here *INSERT LINK*. 

The Visual Studio Solution is included in this repo. If you open it up, you should be able to compile and run your program. 

The default program run is 2D_Graphics.cpp. If you want to change to run 3D_Graphics.cpp, 
just uncomment the respective lines in Main.cpp and comment the others.
